# Robotics Navigation Algorithms

In this repo, I'll be attempting to implement in Python a few robotics navigation algorithms that are currently supported in [Navigation2](https://navigation.ros.org/). The main inspiration for this project was this [awesome publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15236.pdf) by the maintainers of Navigation2.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me and/or raise PR in case you are interested in contributing to this repo. :)
