# Robotics Navigation Algorithms

In this repo, I'll be attempting to implement a few robotics navigation algorithms that are currently supported in [Navigation2](https://navigation.ros.org) so that I can improve my understanding of them. Python was the chosen language for this project as the main purpose is to cut to the chase quickly while creating visualisations wherever possible. A big shout out to the awesome maintainers of Navigation2 for this [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15236.pdf) where they summarize the algorithms.
